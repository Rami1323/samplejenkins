"Hi All,_x000D_
_x000D_
Based on my meeting with Aravind and my discussions with SDF team on teams I have noted the below action items_x000D_
_x000D_
•	Security Vulnerabilities:_x000D_
o	Team can ignore the alerts in amber or yellow. They need to address only the ones in Red._x000D_
o	The oracle jdbc version we should be using is com.oracle.jdbc : ojdbc7 : 12.1.0.2. We are using this version but the report still shows com.oracle.jdbc : ojdbc7 : 12.1.0.1. Aravind confirmed we can ignore that I this is the case._x000D_
o	The Spring Framework version being used in the current builds (org.springframework : spring-beans : 5.3.19) is fine. We should try to go to next sub-version if possible (org.springframework : spring-beans : 5.3.20). Even if we stay on current version that is fine._x000D_
•	Licensing Vulnerabilities:_x000D_
o	If the builds are in unstable/success status and the version is available on nexus we can ignore all the licensing vulnerabilities in the nexus report. We can treat them as false positives._x000D_
